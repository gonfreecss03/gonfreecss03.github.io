<p>Nik and I met on a blind date to the movies, and I wasn't happy about the blind date till I got to know Nik. Then I was happy I met him. After our blind date it took me around 3-4 months before I finally said yes to dating him; even though it was already like we were dating. He ended up asking me many, many times. We started to officially date March 9th 2019 after he asked me to be his girlfriend at a bingo tournament! On the day of our marriage we will have been together two and a half years.Nik proposed on the space needle in Seattle Washington on August 8, 2020 on his birthday, it was a very exciting and happy day for the both of us. I was super surprised, I did nt expect it at all! We are very happy together and could not imagine a day without one another. Many more memories to come. <3
